	abstract = {Abstract. China is regarded as the largest contributor of mercury (Hg) to the global atmospheric Hg budget. However, concentration levels and depositions of atmospheric Hg in China are poorly known. Continuous measurements of atmospheric gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) were carried out from May 2008 to May 2009 at the summit of Mt. Leigong in south China. Simultaneously, deposition fluxes of THg and MeHg in precipitation, throughfall and litterfall were also studied. Atmospheric GEM concentrations averaged 2.80±1.51 ng m−3, which was highly elevated compared to global background values but much lower than semi-rural and industrial/urban areas in China. Sources identification indicates that both regional industrial emissions and long range transport of Hg from central, south and southwest China were corresponded to the elevated GEM level. Seasonal and diurnal variations of GEM were observed, which reflected variations in source intensity, deposition processes and meteorological factors. Precipitation and throughfall deposition fluxes of THg and MeHg in Mt. Leigong were comparable or lower compared to those reported in Europe and North America, whereas litterfall deposition fluxes of THg and MeHg were higher compared to Europe and North America. This highlights the importance of vegetation to Hg atmospheric cycling. In th remote forest ecosystem of China, deposition of GEM via uptake of foliage followed by litterfall was very important for the depletion of atmospheric Hg. Elevated GEM level in ambient air may accelerate the foliar uptake of Hg through air which may partly explain the elevated litterfall deposition fluxes of Hg observed in Mt. Leigong.},

The spatial distribution of gaseous elemental mercury (Hg0) concentrations in ambient air were monitored using a mobile RA-915+ Zeeman Mercury Analyzer during daytime and night time in May 2010. The data imply that calcines and mine wastes piles located at Dashuixi and on-going artisanal Hg mining activities at Supeng were major sources of atmospheric mercury in WMMA. For a full year (May 2010 to May 2011), sampling of precipitation and throughfall were conducted on a weekly basis at three sites (Shenchong, Dashuixi, and Supeng) within WMMA. Hg in deposition was characterized by analysis of total Hg (THg) and dissolved Hg (DHg) concentrations. The corresponding data exhibit a high degree of variability, both temporarily and spatially. The volume-weighted mean THg concentrations in precipitation and throughfall samples were 502.6 ng l−1 and 977.8 ng l−1 at Shenchong, 814.1 ng l−1and 3392.1 ng l−1 at Dashuixi, 7490.1 ng l−1and 9641.5 ng l−1 at Supeng, respectively. THg was enhanced in throughfall compared to wet deposition samples by up to a factor of 7. The annual wet Hg deposition fluxes were 29.1, 68.8 and 593.1 μg m−2 yr−1 at Shenchong, Dashuixi and Supeng, respectively, while the annual dry Hg deposition fluxes were estimated to be 378.9, 2613.6 and 6178 μg m−2 yr−1 at these sites, respectively. Dry deposition played a dominant role in total atmospheric Hg deposition in WMMA since the dry deposition fluxes were 10.4–37.9 times higher than the wet deposition fluxes during the whole sample period. Our data showed that air deposition was still an important pathway of Hg contamination to the local environment in WMMA.},

              Forest ecosystems play an important role in the global cycling of mercury (Hg). In this study, we characterized the Hg cycling at a remote evergreen broadleaf (EB) forest site in southwest China (Mount Ailao). The annual Hg input via litterfall is estimated to be 75.0 ± 24.2 µg m

               yr

              at Mount Ailao. Such a quantity is up to 1 order of magnitude greater than those observed at remote temperate/boreal (T/B) forest sites. Production of litter biomass is found to be the most influential factor causing the high Hg input to the EB forest. Given their large areal coverage, Hg deposition through litterfall in EB forests is appropriately 9 ± 5 Mg yr
              −1
              in China and 1086 ± 775 Mg yr
              −1
              globally. The observed wet Hg deposition at Mount Ailao is 4.9 ± 4.5 µg m
              −2
               yr
              −1
              , falling in the lower range of those observed at 49 T/B forest sites in North America and Europe. Given the data, the Hg deposition flux through litterfall is approximately 15 times higher than the wet Hg deposition at Mount Ailao. Steady Hg accumulation in decomposing litter biomass and Hg uptake from the environment were observed during 25 months of litter decomposition. The size of the Hg pool in the organic horizon of EB forest floors is estimated to be up to 2–10 times the typical pool size in T/B forests. This study highlights the importance of EB forest ecosystems in global Hg cycling, which requires further assessment when more data become available in tropical forests.

	abstract = {Abstract. This study presents data on mercury (Hg) concentrations, stochiometric relations to carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), and Hg pool sizes in four Sierra Nevada forest sites of similar exposure and precipitation regimes, and hence similar atmospheric deposition, to evaluate how ecosystem parameters control Hg retention in ecosystems. In all four sites, the largest amounts of Hg reside in soils which account for 94–98\% of ecosystem pools. Hg concentrations and Hg/C ratios increase in the following order: Green Needles/Leaves{\textless}Dry Needles/Leaves{\textless}Oi litter{\textless}Oe litter{\textless}Oa litter. Stochiometric relations show negative correlations between Hg and C (r2=0.58) and N and C (r2=0.64) in decomposing litter, but a positive correlation between litter Hg and N (r2=0.70). These inverse relations may reflect preferential retention of N and Hg over C during decomposition, or may be due to older age of decomposed litter layers which are exposed to longer-term atmospheric Hg deposition in the field. The results indicate that litter Hg levels depend on decomposition stage and may not follow generally observed positive relationships between Hg and organic C.  Mineral soil layers show strong positive correlations of Hg to C across all sites and soil horizons (r2=0.83), but Hg concentrations are even more closely related to N with a similar slope to that observed in litter (r2=0.92). Soil N levels alone explain over 90\% of Hg pool sizes across the four Sierra Nevada forest sites. This suggests that soil organic N and C groups provide sorption sites for Hg to retain atmospheric deposition. However, the patterns could be due to indirect relationships where high soil N and C levels reflect high ecosystem productivity which leads to corresponding high atmospheric Hg deposition inputs via leaf litterfall and plant senescence. Our results also show that two of the sites previously affected by prescribed burning and wildfires show significant depletion of above-ground Hg pools but that belowground Hg pools remain unaffected. We conclude that sequestration of Hg in remote Sierra Nevada forest sites is strongly co-determined by ecosystem parameters with C and N pools being excellent determinants for the pool sizes of Hg.},

            Foliar accumulation of mercury has been demonstrated to occur as plants leaf out, yet the primary source of this mercury is not known. Using closed-system growth chambers, uptake of mercury by quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) foliage was measured over time as a function of soil mercury concentrations (0.01, 6.2, and 25.6 μg/g) and atmospheric mercury exposure concentrations (1.4, 14.9, and 68.5 ng/m3). Foliar mercury concentrations increased as a function of time for all exposures. Twice during the experiment, leaf washes were analyzed for mercury to assess surface deposition, and little mercury was removed (0.02-0.04 ng/m2), suggesting that direct deposition to the leaf surface was not significant during this experiment. At the end of the four-month experiment, whole-plant mercury concentrations were determined. It was found that whereas mercury in the atmosphere primarily influenced foliar uptake, root concentrations were related to the soil mercury concentration. The implication of this study is that litterfall may serve as a pathway for new, atmospherically derived mercury to be deposited to forest soils. This has significant implications for watershed management of ecosystems where mercury is of concern.},

              Most published research evaluating total (wet + dry) mercury (Hg) deposition in eastern North America has been conducted during the growing season. However, recent research indicates that winter throughfall Hg deposition can be significant. We reviewed and synthesized published and unpublished snow Hg concentration and deposition data collected at forested and open sites from 1989 to 2005 (14 studies) using various field methods. Mean snow Hg concentrations across years and locations ranged from 0·66 to 22·7 ng l
              −1
              [standard deviation (SD): 15–99\%]. Snow Hg deposition and concentration were consistently highest in conifer throughfall and lowest at open sites (no vegetation cover). These results suggest that the range of snow Hg deposition can be bracketed by sampling at two extremes: under conifer canopies and in open sites. Ratios of Hg in snowpack under tree canopies versus open sites were 3·4:1 (conifers) and 2·1:1 (all forest types). Ratios of event throughfall to wet‐only collections were 5·0:1 (conifers) and 3·8:1 (all forest types), exceeding the previously reported overall average of throughfall to wet‐only for the growing season. Future research should standardize snow Hg sampling methods to address volatilization and dry deposition. Mechanisms contributing to variability in snow Hg deposition could be assessed by measuring particulate Hg and examining interannual and spatial patterns. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

              Globally, foliar uptake of atmospheric mercury (Hg) is a key deposition pathway for terrestrial surfaces. However, diverse sampling and pre-treatment methods across studies can influence the comparability of foliar Hg concentrations and isotopic measurements, leading to biases that impact our understanding of Hg inter-compartmental exchanges at regional and global scale. In this study, we tested the effect of different sample drying and rinsing methods on foliage samples collected from three distinct locations on the tree crown of a European hornbeam (
              Carpinus Betulus L.
              ). Samples were taken from Ljubljana, an urban area, and Idrija, a historically Hg-contaminated mining site, representing contrasting environments. Vertical crown stratification significantly influenced Hg concentrations, with inner canopy foliage in Ljubljana containing 46–50\% higher Hg than outer and upper positions due to reduced solar exposure and enhanced throughfall deposition. Drying methods did not alter Hg concentrations (
              p
               {\textgreater} 0.05), validating cross-study comparability for low-Hg environments. Conversely, rinsing removed 24–60\% of Hg in Idrija samples (
              p
               {\textless} 0.01), attributable to particulate-bound Hg (PBM) enriched in heavier isotopes (δ
              20
              2
              Hg: -1.9 ± 1.5‰ unrinsed vs. -3.2 ± 1.0‰ rinsed). We recommend that rinsing be applied when studying internal plant Hg cycling, but omitted when total foliage-associated Hg, including surface-bound fractions, is of interest. Future studies should investigate inter-species differences, seasonal variability in foliar Hg dynamics, and the effects of drying methods on Hg isotopic fractionation to improve methodological consistency and understanding of Hg cycling.},

              Concentrations and fluxes of mercury (Hg) species in surface waters of forested watersheds are affected by hydrological events. The mechanisms of Hg transport during these events are poorly understood and yet may influence Hg bioavailability and exposure to aquatic biota. Three storm events with varying magnitude and intensity were investigated (June, September and November 2005) at a forested watershed in the Adirondack region of New York State, USA. Concentrations of Hg species increased during these events, both above and downstream of wetlands in the watershed. While Hg flux was higher from wetland drainage, the Hg flux from the upland site exhibited a greater relative increase to elevated runoff. Hg flux was controlled by discharge; however, Hg species concentrations were not well correlated with discharge, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), or total suspended solids (TSS) through the duration of events. A counter‐clockwise hysteresis response of DOC with increasing runoff contrasted with the clockwise response for total Hg, suggesting different contributions from source areas for these solutes.

              (α {\textless} 0·05) during the rising limb of the hydrograph suggests rapid delivery of throughfall Hg, potentially enhanced by hillslope hollows, to the stream channel. As the watershed saturated, stream Hg appears to be derived from the soil Hg pool. Results suggest that particulate Hg did not contribute substantially to total Hg flux during events ({\textless}25\%). These results emphasize the role of watershed attributes and storm characteristics in Hg transport and bioavailability. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Recent studies demonstrate a short 3–6-month atmospheric lifetime for mercury (Hg). This implies Hg emissions are predominantly deposited within the same hemisphere in which they are emitted, thus placing increasing importance on considering Hg sources, sinks and impacts from a hemispheric perspective. In the absence of comprehensive Hg data from the Southern Hemisphere (SH), estimates and inventories for the SH have been drawn from data collected in the NH, with the assumption that the NH data are broadly applicable. In this paper, we centre the uniqueness of the SH in the context of natural biogeochemical Hg cycling, with focus on the midlatitudes and tropics. Due to its uniqueness, Antarctica warrants an exclusive review of its contribution to the biogeochemical cycling of Hg and is therefore excluded from this review. We identify and describe five key natural differences between the hemispheres that affect the biogeochemical cycling of Hg: biome heterogeneity, vegetation type, ocean area, methylation hotspot zones and occurence of volcanic activities. We review the current state of knowledge of SH Hg cycling within the context of each difference, as well as the key gaps that impede our understanding of natural Hg cycling in the SH. The differences demonstrate the limitations in using NH data to infer Hg processes and emissions in the SH.},

              Karst s.l. were collected in the stemflow and throughfall areas of beech stands on four soil types in Hungary in order to compare their chemical element contents. The amount of rhizomorphs found in the samples increased with decreasing pH of the soil types as well as with decreasing pH caused by the influence of stemflow water. Least rhizomorphs were collected in the Ranker, whereas most were found in the stemflow areas of the pod‐ zolized Brown Earth. Rhizomorph and beech root samples, collected for comparison, showed highly significant differences in their chemical element contents. Rhizomorphs contained less B, Fe. Ga, Li, Mg, Mn, Ti and V, but more Cd, Co, P, Pb, Si and Zn in all soil types than comparable beech root samples. Remarkable was the high Pb content of rhizomorphs, which is not characteristic of mushroom fruiting bodies collected in unpolluted areas.

Throughfall and stemflow contributed twice as much HgT and seven times as much OC to the forested watershed than atmospheric deposition in a nearby opening. Fluxes in upland runoff accounted for 16\% of the HgT and 8\% of the OC inputs to the lagg and were dominated by interflow transport. Bog runoff accounted for 57\% of the HgT and 83\% of the OC inputs to the lagg. For an annual cycle, upland soils were sinks for both HgT and OC, while bog soils were sinks for HgT but sources of OC. Fluxes to the lagg accounted for 184\% of the HgT and 87\% of the OC transported from the watershed outlet. We speculate that HgT was lost in the lagg by both volatilization and soil accumulation. Total Hg and dissolved organic C (DOC) are positively related in both throughfall and stemflow, with stemflow showing the strongest relationships. In the soil system, HgT–DOC relationships deteriorate and HgT–particulate organic C (POC) relationships dominate. Water residence time in contact with OC appears to be important in determining the relationships between HgT and OC. At the stream outlet, our data suggest that ≈70\% of the HgT transported from the watershed is associated with POC, while 30\% is associated with DOC.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Estuaries are a conduit of mercury (Hg) from watersheds to the coastal ocean, and salt marshes play an important role in coastal Hg cycling. Hg cycling in upland terrestrial ecosystems has been well studied, but processes in densely vegetated salt marsh ecosystems are poorly characterized. We investigated Hg dynamics in vegetation and soils in the Plum Island Sound estuary in Massachusetts, USA, and specifically assessed the role of marsh vegetation for Hg deposition and turnover. Monthly quantitative harvesting of aboveground biomass showed strong linear seasonal increases in Hg associated with plants, with a 4-fold increase in Hg concentration and an 8-fold increase in standing Hg mass from June (3.9 ± 0.2 µg kg−1 and 0.7 ± 0.4 µg m−2, respectively) to November (16.2 ± 2.0 µg kg−1 and 5.7 ± 2.1 µg m−2, respectively). Hg did not increase further in aboveground biomass after plant senescence, indicating physiological controls of vegetation Hg uptake in salt marsh plants. Hg concentrations in live roots and live rhizomes were 11 and 2 times higher than concentrations in live aboveground biomass, respectively. Furthermore, live belowground biomass Hg pools (Hg in roots and rhizomes, 108.1 ± 83.4 µg m−2) were more than 10 times larger than peak standing aboveground Hg pools (9.0 ± 3.3 µg m−2). A ternary mixing model of measured stable Hg isotopes suggests that Hg sources in marsh aboveground tissues originate from about equal contributions of root uptake (∼ 35 \%), precipitation uptake (∼ 33 \%), and atmospheric gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) uptake (∼ 32 \%). These results suggest a more important role of Hg transport from belowground (i.e., roots) to aboveground tissues in salt marsh vegetation than upland vegetation, where GEM uptake is generally the dominant Hg source. Roots and soils showed similar isotopic signatures, suggesting that belowground tissue Hg mostly derived from soil uptake. Annual root turnover results in large internal Hg recycling between soils and plants, estimated at 58.6 µg m−2 yr−1. An initial mass balance of Hg indicates that the salt marsh presently serves as a small net Hg sink for environmental Hg of 5.2 µg m−2 yr−1.},

	abstract = {Soil pollution by mercury (Hg) is a global problem that poses risks to natural ecosystems and to human health. Forests represent an important recipient of Hg deposition, however, so far, very little is known about the tree species identity effects on the distribution of Hg in forest soils and its accumulation in edible mushrooms. To clarify the effect on the two main Central-European commercial forest tree species, soil samples were collected from organic F+H horizons and from mineral soil depths of 0–2, 2–10, 10–20, and 20–30 cm in mature Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) dominated stands. Mushroom samples of the Boletaceae family were also collected at each sampling site. The highest Hg contents were found in the F+H layer and were significantly higher in spruce- (mean 0.46 ± 0.03 mg/kg) than in beech- (mean 0.29 ± 0.10 mg/kg) dominated stands. The variation in Hg contents in F+H was best predicted by pH, the overall lower soil pH in strongly acidic spruce stands might induce Hg immobilization in the F+H layer to cause a decrease in the bioavailability of Hg for Xerocomellus chrysenteron (Bull.) Šutara. In mineral soil, the Hg contents did not differ significantly between the spruce- and beech-dominated stands. The Hg content strongly correlated with the S, N, and C contents only in mineral soil; at the depths of 2–10, 10–20, and 20–30 cm, significantly also with the silt vs. sand, Alo, and Feo contents. Studied mushroom species were not Hg-contaminated and, therefore, their consumption does not pose serious health risks regardless of the forest type. The results suggest that species-related soil chemistry and mineral associations, rather than different atmospheric Hg interception by spruce vs. beech, drive the vertical distribution and accumulation of Hg in forest soils.},

          , 
            
              Mercury (Hg), a neurotoxic heavy metal, is transferred to marine and terrestrial ecosystems through atmospheric transport. Recent studies have highlighted the role of vegetation uptake as a sink for atmospheric elemental mercury (Hg
              0
              ) and a source of Hg to soils. However, the global magnitude of the Hg
              0
              vegetation uptake flux is highly uncertain, with estimates ranging 1000–4000 Mg per year. To constrain this sink, we compare simulations in the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem with a compiled database of litterfall, throughfall, and flux tower measurements from 93 forested sites. The prior version of GEOS-Chem predicts median Hg
              0
              dry deposition velocities similar to litterfall measurements from Northern hemisphere temperate and boreal forests (∼0.03 cm s
              −1
              ), yet it underestimates measurements from a flux tower study (0.04 cm s
              −1
              vs.
              0.07 cm s
              −1
              ) and Amazon litterfall (0.05 cm s
              −1
              vs.
              0.17 cm s
              −1
              ). After revising the Hg
              0
              reactivity within the dry deposition parametrization to match flux tower and Amazon measurements, GEOS-Chem displays improved agreement with the seasonality of atmospheric Hg
              0
              observations in the Northern midlatitudes. Additionally, the modelled bias in Hg
              0
              concentrations in South America decreases from +0.21 ng m
              −3
              to +0.05 ng m
              −3
              . We calculate a global flux of Hg
              0
              dry deposition to land of 2276 Mg per year, approximately double previous model estimates. The Amazon rainforest contributes 29\% of the total Hg
              0
              land sink, yet continued deforestation and climate change threatens the rainforest's stability and thus its role as an important Hg sink. In an illustrative worst-case scenario where the Amazon is completely converted to savannah, GEOS-Chem predicts that an additional 283 Mg Hg per year would deposit to the ocean, where it can bioaccumulate in the marine food chain. Biosphere–atmosphere interactions thus play a crucial role in global Hg cycling and should be considered in assessments of future Hg pollution.},

	abstract = {Contaminated soils at former mercury (Hg) mines release Hg into the atmosphere that can be absorbed by the surrounding foliage and potentially contribute to inputs of Hg to downstream reservoirs and the food chain. Information on Hg re-emissions and atmospheric transport at the New Almaden Mining District (NAMD) in California’s Coast Range is lacking, despite the wealth of previous research at the site. This study addressed knowledge gaps regarding the locations of the highest Hg re-emissions using
              in-situ
              and transplanted lichens. High total Hg (THg) concentrations in lichen (up to 20 μg g
              −1
              ) were found where ore-processing occurred pre-1900 and where the largest mines were. Mean background concentration of THg in lichen (156.3 ± 48.2 ng g
              −1
              ) was observed \&gt;7.8 km away from the most contaminated site. Lichen THg was significantly higher than the background by 93–171 ng g
              −1
              at locations along the shorelines of three small reservoirs in the NAMD. By transplanting lichens from background areas to three sites in the NAMD, statistically significant first-order rate constants of Hg uptake (0.0011–0.0036 days
              −1
              ) were found. The trend in uptake rate constants matched the trend in THg concentrations in non-transplanted lichen and atmospheric concentrations monitored by Hg passive samplers. There was no trend in the control transplants nor in release rates. Speciation analysis of lichen samples collected from sites of highest contamination using Hg High Energy Resolution Fluorescence Detection (HERFD) XANES showed the dominance of α-HgS (cinnabar) in spectra, likely present as nanoparticles, in addition to variable Hg coordination by dithiol, sulfide, and chloride ligands at the micrometer scale. These results indicate that the majority of Hg in lichen is associated with non-volatile phases and/or organic species and suggest that a relatively small fraction of Hg exchanges with the atmosphere, in agreement with relatively low uptake rates. Overall, study results show that THg concentrations in lichen surveys have merit across gradients of contamination and indicate that Hg deposited to lichens is likely sequestered for many years before entering the soil as litterfall.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Several recent investigations into montane regions have reported on excess mercury accumulation in high-altitude forest ecosystems. This study explored the Singalila National Park, located on the Singalila ridge of the Eastern Himalayas, revealing substantial mercury contamination. Particular focus was on Sandakphu (3636 m), the highest peak in West Bengal, India. It harboured 6.77 ± 0.01 mg/kg of total mercury in its topsoil. Further evidence was provided by accumulation in leaves (0.040 ± 0.01 mg/kg), and roots (0.150 ± 0.008 mg/kg) of local vegetation, litterfall (0.234 ± 0.019 mg/kg), mosses (0.367 ± 0.043 mg/kg), surface water from local lakes and waterbodies (0.010 ± 0.005 mg/l), fresh snow (0.014 ± 0.004 mg/l), and sleet (0.019 ± 0.009 mg/l). Samples from other points of varying elevation in the park also demonstrated contamination. The soil displayed a range of 0.068–5.28 mg/kg, while the mean concentration in leaves was 0.153 ± 0.105 mg/kg, roots was 0.106 ± 0.054 mg/kg, and leaf litter was 0.240 ± 0.112 mg/kg. Additionally, the microbial consortia isolated from the contaminated soil displayed a high tolerance to mercuric chloride, presumably gained through repeated and consistent exposure. Four high tolerance bacterial strains, MTS2C, MTS3A, MTS4B and MTS6A, were further characterized for potential use in bioremediation strategies. Their mercury removal capacities were determined to be 82.35\%, 75.21\%, 61.95\%, and 37.47\%, respectively. Overall, the findings presented provide evidence for a highly contaminated environment in the Singalila National Park, that poses significant ecological risk to the flora, fauna and local inhabitants of this biodiversity hotspot. This research also highlights the need for further exploration and monitoring of the Eastern Himalayas for its role as a sink for atmospheric mercury.},

	abstract = {Mercury is one of the most toxic heavy metal pollutants, and mercury absorbed by plant leaves accumulates in forests in the form of litterfall. Therefore, in this study, leaf mercury concentrations and mercury fluxes were analyzed in typical sample plots of each vegetation type, which were selected from 7 geographic regions in China. The results showed that the amount of litterfall of each component varied among different vegetation types, with leaves accounting for the largest proportion (51.12\% to 80.54\%). The annual amount of leaf litter ranged from 3.35 to 5.50 t/(hm
              2
              ·year). On the seasonal scale, the litterfall amount peaked in the autumn for most vegetation types. On a spatial scale, the litterfall amount displayed a decreasing trend with increasing latitude, with the highest of 8.16 ± 4.61 t/(hm

Leaf mercury concentrations of most tree species increased gradually with the growing period and showed a pattern of higher in the south and lower in the north on the spatial scale. Furthermore, leaf mercury fluxes of the 5 vegetation types ranged from 177.58 to 410.50 mg/(hm

The comprehensive quantification of mercury fluxes in this paper provides data support for the long-term monitoring of litterfall and fundamental information to potentially solve the problem of mercury pollution in China.},

Hence, the aim of this work was to determine the total mercury [THg] and methylmercury [MeHg] concentrations in litter and surface soil, MeHg deposition via litterfall, and the MeHg fate during a forest fire in the Amazonian rainforest. Sampling of litter, soil (0–1, 1–2, and 2–5 cm), and ash was carried out before (BB) and after (AB) a prescribed forest fire. The results showed a low [THg] (34 ± 8 ng g
              -1
              ) and [MeHg] (0.16 ± 0.03 ng g

              yr
              -1

              and 0.11 ± 0.04 ng g
              -1
              , respectively. Although a significant part of Hg contained in the biomass was lost during the fire, the [MeHg]/[THg] ratio was not affected by it and was the same in litterfall and ash (∼0.5\%). In soil, the average [THg] BB value was 149 ± 12 ng g
              -1
              in the three layers and [MeHg] was between 0.8 and 1.0 ng g
              -1
              . The forest fire only affected the superficial soil, with a significant decrease of [THg] and [MeHg] in the 0-1 cm layer. Similarly, the decrease of the [MeHg]/[THg] ratio in the surface soil layer suggested that MeHg was more readily emitted or degraded than the other Hg species present.},

	abstract = {Environmental context
              Mosses and lichens are widely distributed in montane forests and their important role in global biogeochemical cycles has been increasingly recognised. This study of mercury accumulation and sources in mosses and lichens, using mercury isotopic data, provides evidence that they promote atmospheric mercury deposition in these forests, which is an important function that should be incorporated into current mercury mass balance budgets for forests.
            
            
              Rationale
              Mosses and lichens, which are widely distributed in montane forests, are often used to monitor the atmospheric mercury (Hg) depositions. In this study we hypothesised that atmospheric Hg uptake by mosses and lichens could greatly promote Hg depositions in montane forests.
            
            
              Methodology
              We comprehensively determined the Hg concentration and isotopic signatures of various species of mosses and lichens in a subtropical montane forest, to quantify the Hg accumulation, influencing factors and potential Hg depositions induced by mosses and lichens.
            
            
              Results
              Our results show that the higher Hg concentrations in mosses than in lichens are mainly due to their species-specific, morphological and physiological differences. Hg isotopic mixing model results display that uptake of atmospheric elemental Hg (Hg0) contributes 89.2 ± 22.8\% of Hg in mosses and 88.4 ± 24.4\% in lichens. The lichens growing on trees have a lower atmospheric Hg0 source contribution than on the ground (61.3 ± 42.5\% versus 93.6 ± 10.0\%) because of the elevated rainfall Hg uptake on trees. The Hg storage in live moss and lichen is 28.0 ± 16.5 and 0.9 ± 1.0 μg m−2, respectively. Given the 1–2-year lifespan of moss, the moss induced atmospheric Hg deposition is almost equivalent to litterfall Hg deposition which was previously used as a proxy for atmospheric Hg0 deposition in forests.
            
            
              Discussion
              Overall, we suggest mosses and lichens play an important role in atmospheric Hg depositions and recommend more research in montane forests.},

	abstract = {Abstract. This study investigates the seasonality of the mercury (Hg)
concentration of olive tree foliage, an iconic tree of the Mediterranean
basin. Hg concentrations of foliage, stems, soil surface, and litter were
analyzed on a monthly basis in ancient olive trees growing in two groves in
Lebanon, Bchaaleh and Kawkaba (1300 and 672 m a.s.l. respectively). A
significantly lower concentration was registered in stems (∼7–9 ng g−1) in comparison to foliage (∼35–48 ng g−1) in both sites,
with the highest foliage Hg concentration in late winter–early spring and
the lowest in summer. It is noteworthy that olive fruits also have low Hg
concentrations (∼7–11 ng g−1). The soil has the highest Hg
content (∼62–129 ng g−1) likely inherited through the cumulated
litter biomass (∼63–76 ng g−1). A good covariation observed
between our foliage Hg time series analysis and those of atmospheric Hg concentrations available for southern Italy in the western Mediterranean
basin confirms that mercury pollution can be studied through olive trees.
Spring sampling is recommended if the objective is to assess the trees'
susceptibility to Hg uptake. Our study draws an adequate baseline for the
eastern Mediterranean and the region with similar climatic inventories on Hg
vegetation uptake, in addition to being a baseline to new studies on olive
trees in the Mediterranean to reconstruct regional Hg pollution
concentrations in the past and present.},

However, observations based on Hg deposition fluxes in worldwide stations under forest ecosystems tend to differ considerably. In this work, a sampling station was set up in Dinghu Mountain to study the atmospheric Hg’s dry and wet deposition in typical forest ecosystems in Southeast China. One hundred and two atmospheric dry and wet deposition samples were collected with an automatic sampler from March 2009 to February 2010, and concentrations of Hg, magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), and chromium (Cr) were detected. The results showed that the annual rainfall weighted average Hg concentration was 56.8 ng L−1, and 79.8 ng L−1 in the dry deposition. The mean total deposition flux was 158.8 μg m−2, and the wet deposition was predominant. The highest and lowest concentrations were detected in the high-temperature rainy season. Generally, the wet deposition flux was notably positively correlated with the rainfall. The source of atmospheric Hg deposition in Dinghu Mountain was analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA). The main source of Hg in precipitation was soil dust, followed by coal and fuel (automobile exhaust). The primary source of Hg in dry deposition was fuel (automobile exhaust), followed by soil dust, which indicates that Dinghu Mountain has been polluted by the anthropogenic sources of Hg.},

Over a decadal timescale, soil Hg variabilities are shaped by the combined effects of atmospheric Hg inputs and processes of organic soil mineralization mediated climatic factors. Our study highlights that the accelerated climate change increases the unpredictability of Hg accumulation in terrestrial ecosystems. Future studies are needed for better understanding the response of Hg biogeochemical cycling to climate change among different terrestrial biomes.

            Plain Language Summary
            The decade‐long observation of litterfall Hg deposition and uppermost soil Hg concentration was carried out at a subtropical forest in Southwest China. Our data clearly display how the extended droughts and largest snowstorm of the past four decades at studied site influencing the foliage and soil Hg cycling. We suggest the drought would increase the litterfall Hg concentration and total deposition flux, and the snowstorm would remarkedly increase the atmospheric Hg burden which derived from the canopy long‐term stored Hg. We highlight that the extreme weather events could disturb the ecological balance and Hg biogeochemical Hg cycling in forest ecosystem.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Gaseous elemental mercury (GEM), the primary form of mercury (Hg) in the atmosphere, can undergo bidirectional exchange with the Earth's surface, with uptake in growing vegetation constituting the dominant atmospheric deposition process. Whereas direction and magnitude of this exchange can be determined using micrometeorological and chamber techniques, these approaches are complex, costly and labor‐intensive, and often only yield fluxes over relatively short time‐scales at few sites. We demonstrate that an inexpensive and easy‐to‐use passive air sampler can identify and quantify vertical GEM concentration gradients on scales ranging from centimeters to tens of meters over long time periods (up to 1.5 years) and with coarse temporal resolution (monthly to seasonally). Samplers were deployed above clean and contaminated soil and through a deciduous forest canopy at two sites in Southern Ontario. Significant and seasonally variable gradients of GEM concentrations, both increasing and decreasing with height above ground, were observed and can be explained through the influence of factors such as soil contamination, canopy growth, temperature, solar irradiance, and snow cover. At a minimum, the sampler can identify the GEM flux direction, but, when combined with the Modified Bowen Ratio method, can also be used to estimate the evaporative GEM flux from mercury‐contaminated soil. We further demonstrate the application of the approach to contaminated site assessment, using a field in Brescia, Italy, known to contain elevated levels of Hg in soil. By allowing for cost‐effective measurements at multiple sites and over extended time periods, passive sampling complements existing techniques for studying atmosphere‐surface exchange of GEM.

              , which dominated as a source of mercury. GEM deposition was five times greater than wet deposition and three times greater than litterfall deposition, which has been used as a proxy for GEM deposition until now. Measured GEM deposition is driven by combined plant GEM uptake and underlying forest floor GEM uptake. Global forests may be a much larger global GEM sink than currently assumed, which may explain high mercury levels in soils across forests. Forest mercury mobilizes via watershed runoff and bioaccumulates in aquatic biota, ultimately leading to mercury exposures in wildlife and humans.
            
          , 
            
              Mercury is toxic to wildlife and humans, and forests are thought to be a globally important sink for gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) deposition from the atmosphere. Yet there are currently no annual GEM deposition measurements over rural forests. Here we present measurements of ecosystem–atmosphere GEM exchange using tower-based micrometeorological methods in a midlatitude hardwood forest. We measured an annual GEM deposition of 25.1 µg ⋅ m
              −2
              (95\% CI: 23.2 to 26.7 1 µg ⋅ m
              −2
              ), which is five times larger than wet deposition of mercury from the atmosphere. Our observed annual GEM deposition accounts for 76\% of total atmospheric mercury deposition and also is three times greater than litterfall mercury deposition, which has previously been used as a proxy measure for GEM deposition in forests. Plant GEM uptake is the dominant driver for ecosystem GEM deposition based on seasonal and diel dynamics that show the forest GEM sink to be largest during active vegetation growing periods and middays, analogous to photosynthetic carbon dioxide assimilation. Soils and litter on the forest floor are additional GEM sinks throughout the year. Our study suggests that mercury loading to this forest was underestimated by a factor of about two and that global forests may constitute a much larger global GEM sink than currently proposed. The larger than anticipated forest GEM sink may explain the high mercury loads observed in soils across rural forests, which impair water quality and aquatic biota via watershed Hg export.},

              From 2011 to 2019, mercury (Hg) stores and fluxes were studied in the small forested catchment Lesní potok (LES) in the central Czech Republic using the watershed mass balance approach together with internal measurements. Mean input fluxes of Hg via open bulk deposition, beech throughfall and spruce throughfall during the periodwere 2.9, 3.9 and 7.6 μg m
              −2
               year
              −1
              , respectively. These values were considerably lower than corresponding deposition Hg fluxes reported in the early years of the 21st century from catchments in Germany. Current bulk precipitation inputs at unimpacted Czech mountainous sites were lower than those in Germany. The largest Hg inputs to the catchment were via litterfall, averaging 22.6 and 17.8 μg m
              −2
               year
              −1
              for beech and spruce stands. The average Hg input, based on the sum of mean litterfall and throughfall deposition, was 23.0 μg m
              −2
               year
              −1
              , compared to the estimated Hg output in runoff of 0.5 μg m
              −2
               year
              −1
              , which is low compared to other reported values. Thus, only {\textasciitilde}2\% of Hg input is exported in stream runoff. Stream water Hg was only weakly related to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) but both concentrations were positively correlated with water temperature. The estimated total soil Hg pool averaged 47.5 mg m
              −2
              , only 4\% of which was in the O‐horizon. Thus Hg in the O‐horizon pool represents 72 years of deposition at the current input flux and 3800 years of export at the current runoff flux. Age‐dating by
              14
              C suggested that organic soil contains Hg from recent deposition, while mineral soil at 40–80 cm depth contained 4400‐year old carbon, suggesting the soil had accumulated atmospheric Hg inputs through millennia to reach the highest soil Hg pool of the soil profile. These findings suggest that industrial era intensification of the Hg cycle is superimposed on a slower‐paced Hg cycle during most of the Holocene.},

Mercury uptake in trees were found to be bidirectional and variable depending on atmospheric Hg conditions. With low atmospheric Hg concentrations, Hg concentrations in tree rings were significantly influenced by soil Hg concentrations via roots. With high atmospheric Hg concentrations, Hg concentrations in tree rings were dominated by atmospheric Hg uptake via foliage. Patterns of Hg concentration in sampling sites were divided into: (1) a linear increase in low concentration of Hg originated from soils via roots during 1967–1977 and (2) an elevated and constant concentration with spatial variation of Hg concentration due to foliar uptake from atmosphere during 1978–2014. Between 1967 and 1977, when shrubs and vegetation senesced each year, there was an annual source of Hg in soils due to continued deposition of Hg to soil via litterfall and debris. Thus, Hg concentration was increased over time. During these periods, Hg concentrations in tree rings reflected uptakes of Hg through roots under young forest and low atmosphere Hg conditions. Whether tree rings can serve as reliable proxies for atmosphere Hg concentrations remain unclear due to Hg uptakes from soils and limits from atmosphere under low atmospheric Hg conditions. Intensified chemical plants and steel mills have continued throughout Yeosu and Gwangyang industrial areas since late 1970s, resulting in high Hg emissions. Hg concentrations in tree rings during 1978–2014 showed elevated and constant levels. In addition, tree ring Hg concentrations at study sites were increased gradually with decreasing distance from industrial areas, with a high concentration of 11.15 ng/g at the Yeosu site located the nearest to industrial areas and a low concentration of 4.34 ng/g at the Suncheon site which was the farthest away from industrial areas.},

              Background
              Understanding the mechanism of Hg accumulation in soil, which is a net Hg sink, at a national scale is important for protecting the environment and improving food safety. The mercury (Hg) distribution in surface soil in China is quite uneven, with relatively high concentrations in southeastern China and low concentrations in northwestern China. The reason for this distribution is inconclusive, especially at the continental scale. In this study, the relative contributions of the key impact factors, including dry and wet deposition, soil organic matter (SOM) and solar radiation to soil Hg, were evaluated.
            
            
              Results
              Wet and dry deposition associated with precipitation and vegetation cover and emissions influenced by SOM are key factors controlling Hg distribution in surface soil. In southeastern China, high levels of wet deposition associated with the South Asia monsoon and dry deposition, enhanced by vegetation canopies, together with low levels of emissions caused by highly vegetated surfaces and solar radiation, are responsible for the high Hg levels in soil ({\textgreater} 0.08 mg/kg). In northeastern China, moderate levels of wet Hg deposition, high levels of dry deposition via throughfall and litterfall, low emissions due to weak solar radiation and high levels of SOM are responsible for high Hg accumulation in soil. In northwestern China, low levels of wet deposition, together with high emissions levels, low vegetation cover (bare soil) and SOM and strong solar radiation, contributed to the low Hg level in the surface soil ({\textless} 0.03 mg/kg).
            
            
              Conclusions
              We suggest that wet deposition derived from the Asian monsoon, dry deposition linked to vegetated surfaces and Hg emissions associated with vegetation cover, SOM and solar radiation play key roles in the soil Hg level in China. In other terrestrial environments worldwide, especially in regions with significantly high levels of wet deposition and high amounts of vegetation cover and soil SOM, high Hg concentrations may exist in the surface soil.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Processes facilitated by precipitation play an important role on mercury (Hg) accumulation on forest floor and therefore key to Hg cycling in forest ecosystems. Sites along the windward slope of 1,250 to 2,400 m at Mt. Ailao, Southwestern China, have higher precipitation than the leeward slope sites. In this study, measurements of Hg concentration and associated stable isotope composition for soil, fresh, and degraded litterfall samples were made at sites along two slopes of Mt. Ailao to quantify the direct and indirect effects of precipitation on Hg accumulation on forest floor. Higher soil Hg concentrations, larger litterfall Hg depositions, and faster litter decomposition rates were observed on the windward slope (1,250–2,400 m). Data of Hg isotopic signatures suggest that Hg in surface soils is mainly derived from litterfall Hg input. Precipitation enhances litterfall Hg deposition by increasing litter biomass production, reduces litter decomposition rate, facilitates short‐term Hg uptake to decomposing litter, and potentially increases microbial activity that increases Hg loss via microbial reduction or runoff. Structural equation modeling results support that the indirect effect of precipitation on increased biomass production merge as the most important factor controlling soil Hg variation. Given the climate forcing on global precipitation pattern and vegetation growth cycle, Hg biogeochemical cycling is likely to continue to evolve under the changing climate.
          , 
            Plain Language Summary
            Precipitation has direct and indirect effects on Hg accumulation and transformation on forest floor. The direct effect is that atmospheric Hg enters into forest floor via precipitation, throughfall, and cloud water deposition. In addition, precipitation likely has an indirect effect on Hg accumulation by influencing litter biomass production and postdepositional processes of Hg, such as litter decomposition, Hg reemission, and surface runoff. The objective of this study is to better quantify the direct and indirect effects of precipitation on Hg accumulation on forest floor. The study sites are located along the leeward and windward slopes of Mt. Ailao in Southwest China. Precipitation intensity is the main variable at the same altitude between two slopes. Our results showed that influences from precipitation on soil Hg accumulation are largely through the indirect effects caused by influencing litterfall Hg deposition. We also suggest that the changed precipitation pattern can force variations of litterfall Hg deposition and soil Hg accumulation globally.

                  Changed precipitation pattern is projected to force changes in global mercury deposition caused by litterfall},

Results showed that the depositions of THg and MeHg through litterfall and throughfall were 86 µg m−2 yr−1 and 0.8 µg m−2 yr−1 respectively, with litterfall acting as a predominant route for the input of both THg and MeHg. The estimated fluxes of THg and MeHg in the throughfall and litterfall were 3 and 4 times greater than those in the precipitation. Methylmercury in the decomposed litter migrates during its erosion by surface runoff and the concentrations of MeHg were quite consistent with that in the surface runoff. Methylmercury mainly accumulated in the lower layer of the litter and upper layer of the soil (Oi), and its transfer through the soil cross-section was delayed. THg retention was not consistent with MeHg, probably with lower soil layers (Oe and Oa) storing and enriching THg in the forest ecosystem. The forest floor of the lower soil is an effective sink for THg but not for MeHg. Methylmercury accumulated in decomposing litter and upper soil layer might transfer with soil percolate, possessing potential ecological risks for residents living around the downstream aquatic systems.},

              Mercury dynamics in the process of litter decomposition is crucial to understanding the atmospheric mercury deposition to soils in the forest catchments. This work aimed to quantify mercury internal biogeochemical cycling and the fractionation process in a coniferous forest and a broad‐leaved forest in southwest China. Annual deposition fluxes of total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) via litterfall were 40.5 and 0.10 μg/m
              2
              in the coniferous forest and were 90.9 and 0.34 μg/m
              2
              in the broad‐leaved forest, respectively. The litterfall biomass was the most influential factor resulting in the higher mercury input in the broad‐leaved forest. During the one‐year incubation, THg and MeHg mass in the decomposing litter increased 49 and 444\% in the coniferous forest compared to those in the broad‐leaved forest, respectively. Methylation has increased the risk of MeHg mobilization to aquatic and soil ecosystems during litter decomposition. Additionally, higher mercury deposition flux but lower accumulation in the broad‐leaved forest resulted in similar mercury content in the coniferous forest soils. Six mercury fractions were determined by sequential extraction for the decomposing litter, while MeHg concentrations were statistically significantly correlated to water soluble and salt soluble fractions. The residual mercury fraction accounted for over 90\% of the THg and increased with litter decomposition. During the last half of the litter decomposition, the ratio of residual fraction significantly increased, while the sum of the other ratios reduced, which indicated that litter dynamics in the internal forests stabilized the mercury in organic soils during litter decomposition.

            Most regional three‐dimensional chemical transport models neglect gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) oxidation by bromine (Br) radicals and Br chemistry. In this study, the Community Multiscale Air Quality model with its default mercury module (CMAQ‐Hg) was modified by implementing a state‐of‐the‐art algorithm depicting Hg reactions coupled with Br chemistry (CMAQ‐newHg‐Br). Using CMAQ‐newHg‐Br with initial and boundary concentrations (ICs and BCs) from global model output, we conducted simulations for the northeastern United States over March–November 2010. Simulated GEM mixing ratios were predominantly influenced by BCs and hence reflected significant seasonal variation that was captured in the global model output as opposed to a lack of seasonal variation using CMAQ‐Hg's default constant BCs. Observed seasonal percentage changes (i.e., seasonal amplitude [=maximum – minimum] in percentage of the seasonal average) of gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM) and particulate bound mercury (PBM) were 76\% and 39\%, respectively. CMAQ‐newHg‐Br significantly improved the simulated seasonal changes in GOM and PBM to 43\% and 23\%, respectively, from 18\% and 16\% using CMAQ‐Hg. CMAQ‐newHg‐Br reproduced observed Hg wet deposition with a remarkably low fractional bias (FB; 0.4\%) as opposed to a −56\% to 19\% FB for CMAQ‐Hg simulations. Simulated Hg dry deposition using CMAQ‐newHg‐Br excluding the GEM + OH reaction agreed well with studies using inferential methods and litterfall/throughfall measurements, and the discrepancy varied over 13\%–42\%. This study demonstrated the promising capability of CMAQ‐newHg‐Br to reproduce observed concentrations and seasonal variations of GEM, GOM and PBM, and Hg wet and dry deposition fluxes.

	abstract = {Spatial patterns and temporal changes in atmospheric-mercury (Hg) deposition were examined in a five-state study area in the Midwestern USA where 32\% of the stationary sources of anthropogenic Hg emissions in the continental USA were located. An extensive monitoring record for wet and dry Hg deposition was compiled for 2001–2016, including 4666 weekly precipitation samples at 13 sites and 27 annual litterfall-Hg samples at 7 sites. This study is the first to examine these Hg data for the Midwestern USA. The median annual precipitation-Hg deposition at the study sites was 10.4 micrograms per square meter per year (µg/m2/year) and ranged from 5.8 µg/m2/year to 15.0 µg/m2/year. The median annual Hg concentration was 9.4 ng/L. Annual litterfall-Hg deposition had a median of 16.1 µg/m2/year and ranged from 9.7 to 23.4 µg/m2/year. Isopleth maps of annual precipitation-Hg deposition indicated a recurring spatial pattern similar to one revealed by statistical analysis of weekly precipitation-Hg deposition. In that pattern, high Hg deposition in southeastern Indiana was present each year, frequently extending to southern Illinois. Most of central Indiana and central Illinois had similar Hg deposition. Areas with comparatively lower annual Hg deposition were observed in Michigan and Ohio for many years and frequently included part of northern Indiana. The area in southern Indiana where high Hg deposition predominated had the highest number of extreme episodes of weekly Hg deposition delivering up to 15\% of the annual Hg load from precipitation in a single week. Modeled 48-h back trajectories indicated air masses for these episodes often arrived from the south and southwest, crossing numerous stationary sources of Hg emissions releasing from 23 to more than 300 kg Hg per year. This analysis suggests that local and regional, rather than exclusively continental or global Hg emissions were likely contributing to the extreme episodes and at least in part, to the spatial patterns of precipitation-Hg deposition in the study area. Statistically significant temporal decreases in weekly precipitation-Hg concentrations in the study area between the periods 2001–2013 and 2014–2016 were observed, coinciding with reported reductions in Hg emissions in the USA required by implementation of national Hg emissions-control rules. These decreases in atmospheric-Hg concentrations are believed to have resulted in the reduced atmospheric-Hg deposition recorded because precipitation depths between the two periods were not significantly different. The Hg-monitoring data for the study area identified an atmospheric deposition response to decreased local and regional Hg emissions.},

            Litterfall is an essential component of tropical forest productivity, transferring nutrients from the vegetation back to soils. Here, we summarize the data from 105 estimates of fine litterfall production from 45 sites in the Atlantic Forest domain, including two types of forests, evergreen and seasonal, and two successional stages, secondary and old growth. The overall litterfall average was 8.0 ± 2.5 Mg/ha. Litterfall was significantly in higher seasonal forests than in evergreen forests and in old growth versus secondary forests. Leaves were the major component of litterfall, contributing 68 percent to the total. The second most important component was branches, contributing 22 percent, followed by reproductive organs (flowers and fruits), at 6 percent. Accurate measurements of tropical forest productivity are crucial for estimating their role in sequestering atmospheric carbon, and we suggest some ways to standardize litterfall sampling to obtain better estimates.

            A serapilheira é componente essencial da produtividade primária em florestas tropicais, transferindo nutrientes da vegetação para o solo. No presente estudo apresentamos 105 estimativas de produção de serapilheira fina obtidas em 45 áreas distintas no Domínio da Mata Atlântica, incluindo dois tipos de florestas: Perene e Decídua, e dois estágios sucessionais: Maduro e Secundário. A média geral da queda de folhas foi de 8.0 ± 2.5 Mg/ha. A média das Florestas Perenes foi de 7.1 ± 2.8 Mg/ha, sendo este valor significativamente menor do que a média obtida dentre as Florestas Decíduas (9.1 ± 2.3 Mg/ha). As florestas Maduras tiveram queda de serapilheira significativamente maior que as florestas Secundárias. As folhas foram o principal componente da serapilheira, contribuindo com 68\% do total. O segundo componente mais importante foram os ramos, contribuindo com 22\%, e órgãos reprodutivos (flores e frutos) contribuindo com 6\%. Medições precisas da produtividade da floresta tropical são cruciais para estimar seu papel no sequestro de carbono atmosférico, e sugerimos algumas maneiras de padronização da amostragem de serapilheira para obter melhores estimativas.},

              Understanding of forest mercury (Hg) pools is important for quantifying the global atmospheric Hg removal. We studied gaseous elemental Hg (GEM) concentrations, litterfall Hg depositions, and pool sizes in four adjacent stands at Mount Dongling to assess Hg dynamics in the forested catchment and the potential of Hg release during wildfires. The average GEM concentration was 2.5 ± 0.5 ng m
              −3
              , about 1.5 times of the background levels in the Northern Hemisphere. In all four stands, Hg concentrations increase in the following order: bole wood {\textless} branch/twig {\textless} bark {\textless} mineral soil {\textless} needles/leaves {\textless} litterfall {\textless} Oi litter {\textless} Oe soil {\textless} Oa organic soil. The Hg pools of aboveground biomass were comparable in the forests of larch, oak, and Chinese pine, which were much greater than that of mixed broadleaf stands due to lower biomass. The total Hg pools in ecosystems were similar in the four stands, because of the comparable Hg pool in the soil horizons (0–40 cm), which accounted for over 97\% of the total ecosystem Hg storage in the four stands. Although Hg pools of the forest ecosystem in north China were comparable to North America and North Europe, Hg storage in forests constituted a high threat for large Hg emission pulses to the atmosphere by wildfires. The potential Hg emissions from the combustion at the four stands were ranged from 0.675 to 1.696 mg m

The current knowledge concerning mercury dry deposition is reviewed, including dry-deposition algorithms used in chemical transport models (CTMs) and at monitoring sites and related deposition calculations, measurement methods and studies for quantifying dry deposition of gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM) and particulate bound mercury (PBM), and measurement studies of litterfall and throughfall mercury. Measured median GOM plus PBM dry deposition in Asia (10.7 µg m−2 yr−1) is almost double that in North America (6.1 µg m−2 yr−1) due to the higher anthropogenic emissions in Asia. The measured mean GOM plus PBM dry deposition in Asia (22.7 µg m−2 yr−1), however, is less than that in North America (30.8 µg m−2 yr−1). The variations between the median and mean values reflect the influences that single extreme measurements can have on the mean of a data set. Measured median litterfall and throughfall mercury are, respectively, 34.8 and 49.0 µg m−2 yr−1 in Asia, 12.8 and 16.3 µg m−2 yr−1 in Europe, and 11.9 and 7.0 µg m−2 yr−1 in North America. The corresponding measured mean litterfall and throughfall mercury are, respectively, 42.8 and 43.5 µg m−2 yr−1 in Asia, 14.2 and 19.0 µg m−2 yr−1 in Europe, and 12.9 and 9.3 µg m−2 yr−1 in North America. The much higher litterfall mercury than GOM plus PBM dry deposition suggests the important contribution of gaseous elemental mercy (GEM) to mercury dry deposition to vegetated canopies. Over all the regions, including the Amazon, dry deposition, estimated as the sum of litterfall and throughfall minus open-field wet deposition, is more dominant than wet deposition for Hg deposition. Regardless of the measurement or modelling method used, a factor of 2 or larger uncertainties in GOM plus PBM dry deposition need to be kept in mind when using these numbers for mercury impact studies.},

            Forest biomass and soils represent some of the largest reservoirs of actively cycling mercury (Hg) on Earth, but many uncertainties exist regarding the source and fate of Hg in forest ecosystems. We systematically characterized stable isotope compositions of Hg in foliage, litter, and mineral soil horizons across 10 forest sites in the contiguous United States. The mass‐independent isotope signatures in all forest depth profiles are more consistent with those of atmospheric Hg(0) than those of atmospheric Hg(II), indicating that atmospheric Hg(0) is the larger source of Hg to forest ecosystems. Within litter horizons, we observed significant enrichment in Hg concentration and heavier isotopes along the depth, which we hypothesize to result from additional deposition of atmospheric Hg(0) during litter decomposition. Furthermore, Hg isotope signatures in mineral soils closely resemble those of the overlying litter horizons suggesting incorporation of Hg from litter as a key source of soil Hg. The spatial distribution of Hg isotope compositions in mineral soils across all sites is modeled by isotopic mixing assuming atmospheric Hg(II), atmospheric Hg(0), and geogenic Hg as major sources. This model shows that northern sites with higher precipitation tend to have higher atmospheric Hg(0) deposition than other sites, whereas drier sites in the western U.S. tend to have higher atmospheric Hg(II) deposition than the rest. We attribute these differences primarily to the higher litterfall Hg input at northern wetter sites due to increased plant productivity by precipitation. These results allow for a better understanding of Hg cycling across the atmosphere‐forest‐soil interface.

Hg fluxes through litterfall ranged from 22.8 to 62.8 µg m−2 yr−1, higher than the wet deposition fluxes by a factor of 3.9 to 8.7 and representing approximately 75 \% of the total Hg deposition at the forest sites in China. This suggests that uptake of atmospheric Hg by foliage is the dominant pathway to remove atmospheric Hg in forest ecosystems in China. Wet deposition fluxes of Hg at rural sites of China were generally lower compared to those in North America and Europe, possibly due to a combination of lower precipitation depth, lower GOM concentrations in the troposphere and the generally lower cloud base heights at most sites that wash out a smaller amount of GOM and PBM during precipitation events.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Mercury (Hg) emission from natural surfaces plays an important role in global Hg cycling. The present estimate of global natural emission has large uncertainty and remains unverified against field data, particularly for terrestrial surfaces. In this study, a mechanistic model is developed for estimating the emission of elemental mercury vapor (Hg0) from natural surfaces in China. The development implements recent advancements in the understanding of air–soil and air–foliage exchange of Hg0 and redox chemistry in soil and on surfaces, incorporates the effects of soil characteristics and land use changes by agricultural activities, and is examined through a systematic set of sensitivity simulations. Using the model, the net exchange of Hg0 between the atmosphere and natural surfaces of mainland China is estimated to be 465.1 Mg yr−1, including 565.5 Mg yr−1 from soil surfaces, 9.0 Mg yr−1 from water bodies, and −100.4 Mg yr−1 from vegetation. The air–surface exchange is strongly dependent on the land use and meteorology, with 9 \% of net emission from forest ecosystems; 50 \% from shrubland, savanna, and grassland; 33 \% from cropland; and 8 \% from other land uses. Given the large agricultural land area in China, farming activities play an important role on the air–surface exchange over farmland. Particularly, rice field shift from a net sink (3.3 Mg uptake) during April–October (rice planting) to a net source when the farmland is not flooded (November–March). Summing up the emission from each land use, more than half of the total emission occurs in summer (51 \%), followed by spring (28 \%), autumn (13 \%), and winter (8 \%). Model verification is accomplished using observational data of air–soil/air–water fluxes and Hg deposition through litterfall for forest ecosystems in China and Monte Carlo simulations. In contrast to the earlier estimate by Shetty et al. (2008) that reported large emission from vegetative surfaces using an evapotranspiration approach, the estimate in this study shows natural emissions are primarily from grassland and dry cropland. Such an emission pattern may alter the current understanding of Hg emission outflow from China as reported by Lin et al. (2010b) because a substantial natural Hg emission occurs in West China.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The mid-subtropical forest area in southwest China was affected by anthropogenic mercury (Hg) emissions over the past 3 decades. We quantified mercury dynamics on the forest field and measured fluxes and pools of Hg in litterfall, throughfall, stream water and forest soil in an evergreen broadleaved forest field in southwestern China. Total Hg (THg) input by the throughfall and litterfall was assessed at 32.2 and 42.9 µg m−2 yr−1, respectively, which was remarkably higher than those observed from other forest fields in the background of North America and Europe. Hg fluxes across the soil–air interface (18.6 mg m−2 yr−1) and runoff and/or stream flow (7.2 µg m−2 yr−1) were regarded as the dominant ways for THg export from the forest field. The forest field hosts an enormous amount of atmospheric Hg, and its reserves is estimated to be 25 341 µg m2. The ratio of output to input Hg fluxes (0.34) is higher compared with other study sites. The higher output / input ratio may represent an important ecological risk for the downstream aquatic ecosystems, even if the forest field could be an effective sink of Hg.},

	abstract = {Abstract. In this study, mercury (Hg) was sampled weekly in dry and wet deposition and throughfall and monthly in litterfall, and as it was volatilized from soil from August 2008 to February 2010 to identify the factors influencing the amount of atmospheric Hg deposited to forested areas in a temperate deciduous forest in South Korea. For this location there was no significant correlation between the estimated monthly dry deposition flux (litterfall + throughfall – wet deposition) (6.7 µg m−2 yr−1) and directly measured dry deposition (9.9 µg m−2 yr−1) likely due primarily to Hg losses from the litterfall collector. Dry deposition fluxes in cold seasons (fall and winter) were lower than in warmer seasons (spring and summer). The volume-weighted mean (VWM) Hg concentrations in both precipitation and throughfall were highest in winter, likely due to increased scavenging by snow events. Since South Korea experiences abundant rainfall in summer, VWM Hg concentrations in summer were lower than in other seasons. Litterfall fluxes were highest in the late fall to early winter, when leaves were dropped from the trees (September to November). The cumulative annual Hg emission flux from soil was 6.8 µg m−2 yr−1. Based on these data, the yearly deposition fluxes of Hg calculated using two input approaches (wet deposition + dry deposition or throughfall + litterfall) were 6.8 and 3.6 µg m−2 yr−1, respectively. This is the first reported study which measured the amount of atmospheric Hg deposited to forested areas in South Korea, and thus our results provide useful information to compare against data related to Hg fate and transport in this part of the world.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Climatic changes in the northeastern US are expected to cause coniferous stands to transition to deciduous stands over the next hundred years. Mercury (Hg) sequestration in forest soils may change as a result. In order to understand potential effects of such a transition, we studied aboveground vegetation and soils at paired coniferous and deciduous stands on eight mountains in Vermont and New Hampshire, USA. Organic horizons at coniferous stands accumulated more total Hg (THg; 42 ± 6 g ha−1) than deciduous stands (30 ± 4 g ha−1). Total Hg pools in the mineral horizons were similar for coniferous (46 ± 8 g ha−1) and deciduous stands (45 ± 7 g ha−1). Soil properties (C, \% clay, and pH) explained 56 \% of the variation in mineral soil Hg concentration when multiply regressed. Foliar and bole wood Hg concentrations were generally greater for coniferous species than deciduous species. Using allometric equations, we estimated that aboveground accumulation of Hg in foliage and woody biomass was similar between vegetation types but that coniferous stands have significantly smaller annual litterfall fluxes (0.03 g ha−1 yr−1) than deciduous stands (0.24 g ha−1 yr−1). We conclude that organic horizon Hg accumulation is influenced by vegetation type but mineral horizon Hg accumulation is primarily controlled by soil properties. Further investigations into the effect of vegetation type on volatilization, atmospheric deposition, and leaching rates are needed to constrain regional Hg cycling rates.},

            Mercury (Hg) is an atmospheric pollutant that, in forest ecosystems, accumulates in foliage and upper soil horizons. The authors measured soil and litterfall Hg at 15 forest sites (northern hardwood to mixed hardwood/conifer) throughout Vermont, USA, to examine variation among tree species, forest type, and soils. Differences were found among the 12 tree species sampled from at least two sites, with Acer pensylvanicum having significantly greater litterfall total Hg concentration. Senescent leaves had greater Hg concentrations if they originated lower in the canopy or had higher surface:weight ratios. Annual litterfall Hg flux had a wide range, 12.6 to 28.5 µg/m2 (mean, 17.9 µg/m2), not related to forest type. Soil and Hg pools in the Oi horizon (litter layer) were not related to the measured Hg deposition flux in litterfall or to total modeled Hg deposition. Despite having lower Hg concentrations, upper mineral soil (A horizons) had greater Hg pools than organic soil horizons (forest floor) due to greater bulk density. Significant differences were found in Hg concentration and Hg/C ratio among soil horizons but not among forest types. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of site history and the benefits of collecting litterfall and soils simultaneously. Observed differences in forest floor Hg pools were strongly correlated with carbon pools, which appeared to be a function of historic land-use patterns. Environ. Toxicol.

	abstract = {As part of the Mercury Experiment to Assess Atmospheric Loading in Canada and the U.S. (METAALICUS), different stable Hg(II) isotope spikes were applied to the upland and wetland areas of a boreal catchment between 2001 and 2006 to examine retention of newly deposited Hg(II). In the present study, a Geographical Information Systems (GIS)‐based approach was used to quantify canopy and ground vegetation pools of experimentally applied upland and wetland spike Hg within the METAALICUS watershed over the terrestrial loading phase of the experiment. A chemical kinetic model was also used to describe the changes in spike Hg concentrations of canopy and ground vegetation over time. An examination of the fate of spike Hg initially present on canopy vegetation using a mass balance approach indicated that the largest percentage flux from the canopy over one year post‐spray was emission to the atmosphere (upland: 45\%; wetland: 71\%), followed by litterfall (upland: 14\%; wetland: 10\%) and throughfall fluxes (upland: 12\%; wetland: 9\%) and longer term retention of spike in the forest canopy (11\% for both upland and wetland). Average half‐lives (t
              1/2
              ) of spike on deciduous (110 ± 30 days) and coniferous (180 ± 40 days) canopy and ground vegetation (890 ± 620 days) indicated that retention of new atmospheric Hg(II) on terrestrial (especially ground) vegetation delays downward transport of new atmospheric Hg(II) into the soil profile and runoff into lakes.

	abstract = {Abstract. Dry deposition of speciated mercury, i.e., gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM), particulate-bound mercury (PBM), and gaseous elemental mercury (GEM), was estimated for the year 2008–2009 at 19 monitoring locations in eastern and central North America. Dry deposition estimates were obtained by combining monitored two- to four-hourly speciated ambient concentrations with modeled hourly dry deposition velocities (Vd) calculated using forecasted meteorology. Annual dry deposition of GOM+PBM was estimated to be in the range of 0.4 to 8.1 μg m−2 at these locations with GOM deposition being mostly five to ten times higher than PBM deposition, due to their different modeled Vd values. Net annual GEM dry deposition was estimated to be in the range of 5 to 26 μg m−2 at 18 sites and 33 μg m−2 at one site. The estimated dry deposition agrees very well with limited surrogate-surface dry deposition measurements of GOM and PBM, and also agrees with litterfall mercury measurements conducted at multiple locations in eastern and central North America. This study suggests that GEM contributes much more than GOM+PBM to the total dry deposition at the majority of the sites considered here; the only exception is at locations close to significant point sources where GEM and GOM+PBM contribute equally to the total dry deposition. The relative magnitude of the speciated dry deposition and their good comparisons with litterfall deposition suggest that mercury in litterfall originates primarily from GEM, which is consistent with the limited number of previous field studies. The study also supports previous analyses suggesting that total dry deposition of mercury is equal to, if not more important than, wet deposition of mercury on a regional scale in eastern North America.},

	abstract = {Litterfall, precipitation and nutrient fluxes were investigated in a 0.25 ha plot of a secondary lowland rain forest in Ile-Ife, Nigeria, for a period of one year. The study determined the magnitude of nutrient fluxes through (litterfall, incident rainfall, throughfall and stemflow) and evaluated the relative importance of these components as pathways of nutrient transport to the soil of this forest. There was a significant monthly variation in litterfall and the highest values of the standing crop of litter occurred from November to March. The concentration of elements in both throughfall and stemflow were higher than those of incidence rainfall. Greater quantities of calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper and nitrogen were deposited annually from the forest floor while greater quantities of mercury, potassium, sodium, phosphorus, lead and sulphur were deposited via precipitation. There was net leaching of all elements from the canopy as precipitation pass through it with the exception of copper, hydrogen ions and lead, which were retained in the canopy. The finding of this study shows that litterfall is the major pathway for the cycling of calcium, magnesium, nitrogen and all micronutrients investigated. Net precipitation is the major pathway for the cycling of potassium, phosphorus, sulphur and trace toxic metals (mercury and lead) in the forest.

O estudo determinou a magnitude dos fluxos de nutrientes através da serrapilheira, da chuva incidente, da interceptada, da escoada pelo tronco, e também avaliou a importância relativa desses componentes como vias de transporte de nutrientes para o solo desta floresta. Houve variação mensal significativa na produção e acúmulo de serapilheira com maiores valores ocorrendo de novembro a março. A concentração de elementos em tanto na chuva interceptada como na escoada pelo tronco foram maiores que na chuva incidente. Maiores quantidades de cálcio, magnésio, ferro, cobre, zinco e nitrogênio foram depositados anualmente a partir da serrapilheira no chão da floresta, enquanto maiores quantidades de mercúrio, potássio, sódio, fósforo, chumbo e enxofre foram depositados através de precipitação. Ocorreu lixiviação de todos os elementos pela passagem da precipitação pelo dossel com a exceção de cobre, íons de hidrogênio, e chumbo, que foram retidos no dossel. Como conclusão este estudo mostra que a serapilheira é a principal via para a ciclagem de cálcio, magnésio, nitrogênio e todos micronutrientes investigados. A precipitação é o principal via para a ciclagem de potássio, fósforo, enxofre e traços de metais tóxicos (mercúrio e chumbo) na floresta.},
