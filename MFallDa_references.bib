          , 
            
              Mercury (Hg), a neurotoxic heavy metal, is transferred to marine and terrestrial ecosystems through atmospheric transport. Recent studies have highlighted the role of vegetation uptake as a sink for atmospheric elemental mercury (Hg
              0
              ) and a source of Hg to soils. However, the global magnitude of the Hg
              0
              vegetation uptake flux is highly uncertain, with estimates ranging 1000–4000 Mg per year. To constrain this sink, we compare simulations in the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem with a compiled database of litterfall, throughfall, and flux tower measurements from 93 forested sites. The prior version of GEOS-Chem predicts median Hg
              0
              dry deposition velocities similar to litterfall measurements from Northern hemisphere temperate and boreal forests (∼0.03 cm s
              −1
              ), yet it underestimates measurements from a flux tower study (0.04 cm s
              −1
              vs.
              0.07 cm s

              vs.
              0.17 cm s
              −1
              ). After revising the Hg
              0
              reactivity within the dry deposition parametrization to match flux tower and Amazon measurements, GEOS-Chem displays improved agreement with the seasonality of atmospheric Hg

              observations in the Northern midlatitudes. Additionally, the modelled bias in Hg
              0
              concentrations in South America decreases from +0.21 ng m
              −3

In an illustrative worst-case scenario where the Amazon is completely converted to savannah, GEOS-Chem predicts that an additional 283 Mg Hg per year would deposit to the ocean, where it can bioaccumulate in the marine food chain. Biosphere–atmosphere interactions thus play a crucial role in global Hg cycling and should be considered in assessments of future Hg pollution.},

              As climate change accelerates, extreme weather events become more severe and frequent. We analyzed the datasets of decade‐long observation (2005–2020) of mercury (Hg) stored in two subtropical evergreen forests to understand the impacts of extreme weather on the sequestration of atmospheric Hg in forest ecosystems.

Litterfall Hg concentration and deposition both display an increasing trend during the period of extended droughts in 2011–2014, but a decreasing trend after droughts. This is caused by the water stress that influences the change of tree physiology and processes of foliage Hg

              uptake. Snowstorm damages large areas of canopy, which leads to substantial canopy epiphyte cover mixed into the forest floor, thus considerably increasing soil Hg concentrations. Over a decadal timescale, soil Hg variabilities are shaped by the combined effects of atmospheric Hg inputs and processes of organic soil mineralization mediated climatic factors. Our study highlights that the accelerated climate change increases the unpredictability of Hg accumulation in terrestrial ecosystems. Future studies are needed for better understanding the response of Hg biogeochemical cycling to climate change among different terrestrial biomes.

            Plain Language Summary
            The decade‐long observation of litterfall Hg deposition and uppermost soil Hg concentration was carried out at a subtropical forest in Southwest China. Our data clearly display how the extended droughts and largest snowstorm of the past four decades at studied site influencing the foliage and soil Hg cycling. We suggest the drought would increase the litterfall Hg concentration and total deposition flux, and the snowstorm would remarkedly increase the atmospheric Hg burden which derived from the canopy long‐term stored Hg. We highlight that the extreme weather events could disturb the ecological balance and Hg biogeochemical Hg cycling in forest ecosystem.

              From 2011 to 2019, mercury (Hg) stores and fluxes were studied in the small forested catchment Lesní potok (LES) in the central Czech Republic using the watershed mass balance approach together with internal measurements. Mean input fluxes of Hg via open bulk deposition, beech throughfall and spruce throughfall during the periodwere 2.9, 3.9 and 7.6 μg m

               year
              −1
              , respectively. These values were considerably lower than corresponding deposition Hg fluxes reported in the early years of the 21st century from catchments in Germany. Current bulk precipitation inputs at unimpacted Czech mountainous sites were lower than those in Germany. The largest Hg inputs to the catchment were via litterfall, averaging 22.6 and 17.8 μg m
              −2
               year
              −1
              for beech and spruce stands. The average Hg input, based on the sum of mean litterfall and throughfall deposition, was 23.0 μg m
              −2
               year
              −1
              , compared to the estimated Hg output in runoff of 0.5 μg m

               year
              −1
              , which is low compared to other reported values. Thus, only {\textasciitilde}2\% of Hg input is exported in stream runoff. Stream water Hg was only weakly related to dissolved organic carbon (DOC) but both concentrations were positively correlated with water temperature. The estimated total soil Hg pool averaged 47.5 mg m
              −2
              , only 4\% of which was in the O‐horizon. Thus Hg in the O‐horizon pool represents 72 years of deposition at the current input flux and 3800 years of export at the current runoff flux. Age‐dating by
              14
              C suggested that organic soil contains Hg from recent deposition, while mineral soil at 40–80 cm depth contained 4400‐year old carbon, suggesting the soil had accumulated atmospheric Hg inputs through millennia to reach the highest soil Hg pool of the soil profile. These findings suggest that industrial era intensification of the Hg cycle is superimposed on a slower‐paced Hg cycle during most of the Holocene.},

            Processes facilitated by precipitation play an important role on mercury (Hg) accumulation on forest floor and therefore key to Hg cycling in forest ecosystems. Sites along the windward slope of 1,250 to 2,400 m at Mt. Ailao, Southwestern China, have higher precipitation than the leeward slope sites. In this study, measurements of Hg concentration and associated stable isotope composition for soil, fresh, and degraded litterfall samples were made at sites along two slopes of Mt. Ailao to quantify the direct and indirect effects of precipitation on Hg accumulation on forest floor. Higher soil Hg concentrations, larger litterfall Hg depositions, and faster litter decomposition rates were observed on the windward slope (1,250–2,400 m). Data of Hg isotopic signatures suggest that Hg in surface soils is mainly derived from litterfall Hg input. Precipitation enhances litterfall Hg deposition by increasing litter biomass production, reduces litter decomposition rate, facilitates short‐term Hg uptake to decomposing litter, and potentially increases microbial activity that increases Hg loss via microbial reduction or runoff. Structural equation modeling results support that the indirect effect of precipitation on increased biomass production merge as the most important factor controlling soil Hg variation. Given the climate forcing on global precipitation pattern and vegetation growth cycle, Hg biogeochemical cycling is likely to continue to evolve under the changing climate.
          , 
            Plain Language Summary
            Precipitation has direct and indirect effects on Hg accumulation and transformation on forest floor. The direct effect is that atmospheric Hg enters into forest floor via precipitation, throughfall, and cloud water deposition. In addition, precipitation likely has an indirect effect on Hg accumulation by influencing litter biomass production and postdepositional processes of Hg, such as litter decomposition, Hg reemission, and surface runoff. The objective of this study is to better quantify the direct and indirect effects of precipitation on Hg accumulation on forest floor. The study sites are located along the leeward and windward slopes of Mt. Ailao in Southwest China. Precipitation intensity is the main variable at the same altitude between two slopes. Our results showed that influences from precipitation on soil Hg accumulation are largely through the indirect effects caused by influencing litterfall Hg deposition. We also suggest that the changed precipitation pattern can force variations of litterfall Hg deposition and soil Hg accumulation globally.

Results showed that the depositions of THg and MeHg through litterfall and throughfall were 86 µg m−2 yr−1 and 0.8 µg m−2 yr−1 respectively, with litterfall acting as a predominant route for the input of both THg and MeHg. The estimated fluxes of THg and MeHg in the throughfall and litterfall were 3 and 4 times greater than those in the precipitation. Methylmercury in the decomposed litter migrates during its erosion by surface runoff and the concentrations of MeHg were quite consistent with that in the surface runoff. Methylmercury mainly accumulated in the lower layer of the litter and upper layer of the soil (Oi), and its transfer through the soil cross-section was delayed. THg retention was not consistent with MeHg, probably with lower soil layers (Oe and Oa) storing and enriching THg in the forest ecosystem. The forest floor of the lower soil is an effective sink for THg but not for MeHg. Methylmercury accumulated in decomposing litter and upper soil layer might transfer with soil percolate, possessing potential ecological risks for residents living around the downstream aquatic systems.},

              Mercury dynamics in the process of litter decomposition is crucial to understanding the atmospheric mercury deposition to soils in the forest catchments. This work aimed to quantify mercury internal biogeochemical cycling and the fractionation process in a coniferous forest and a broad‐leaved forest in southwest China. Annual deposition fluxes of total mercury (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) via litterfall were 40.5 and 0.10 μg/m
              2
              in the coniferous forest and were 90.9 and 0.34 μg/m
              2
              in the broad‐leaved forest, respectively. The litterfall biomass was the most influential factor resulting in the higher mercury input in the broad‐leaved forest. During the one‐year incubation, THg and MeHg mass in the decomposing litter increased 49 and 444\% in the coniferous forest compared to those in the broad‐leaved forest, respectively. Methylation has increased the risk of MeHg mobilization to aquatic and soil ecosystems during litter decomposition. Additionally, higher mercury deposition flux but lower accumulation in the broad‐leaved forest resulted in similar mercury content in the coniferous forest soils. Six mercury fractions were determined by sequential extraction for the decomposing litter, while MeHg concentrations were statistically significantly correlated to water soluble and salt soluble fractions. The residual mercury fraction accounted for over 90\% of the THg and increased with litter decomposition. During the last half of the litter decomposition, the ratio of residual fraction significantly increased, while the sum of the other ratios reduced, which indicated that litter dynamics in the internal forests stabilized the mercury in organic soils during litter decomposition.

                  Litterfall mercury deposition was much higher in the broadleaf forest than that in the coniferous forest

	abstract = {Spatial patterns and temporal changes in atmospheric-mercury (Hg) deposition were examined in a five-state study area in the Midwestern USA where 32\% of the stationary sources of anthropogenic Hg emissions in the continental USA were located. An extensive monitoring record for wet and dry Hg deposition was compiled for 2001–2016, including 4666 weekly precipitation samples at 13 sites and 27 annual litterfall-Hg samples at 7 sites. This study is the first to examine these Hg data for the Midwestern USA. The median annual precipitation-Hg deposition at the study sites was 10.4 micrograms per square meter per year (µg/m2/year) and ranged from 5.8 µg/m2/year to 15.0 µg/m2/year. The median annual Hg concentration was 9.4 ng/L. Annual litterfall-Hg deposition had a median of 16.1 µg/m2/year and ranged from 9.7 to 23.4 µg/m2/year. Isopleth maps of annual precipitation-Hg deposition indicated a recurring spatial pattern similar to one revealed by statistical analysis of weekly precipitation-Hg deposition. In that pattern, high Hg deposition in southeastern Indiana was present each year, frequently extending to southern Illinois. Most of central Indiana and central Illinois had similar Hg deposition. Areas with comparatively lower annual Hg deposition were observed in Michigan and Ohio for many years and frequently included part of northern Indiana. The area in southern Indiana where high Hg deposition predominated had the highest number of extreme episodes of weekly Hg deposition delivering up to 15\% of the annual Hg load from precipitation in a single week. Modeled 48-h back trajectories indicated air masses for these episodes often arrived from the south and southwest, crossing numerous stationary sources of Hg emissions releasing from 23 to more than 300 kg Hg per year. This analysis suggests that local and regional, rather than exclusively continental or global Hg emissions were likely contributing to the extreme episodes and at least in part, to the spatial patterns of precipitation-Hg deposition in the study area. Statistically significant temporal decreases in weekly precipitation-Hg concentrations in the study area between the periods 2001–2013 and 2014–2016 were observed, coinciding with reported reductions in Hg emissions in the USA required by implementation of national Hg emissions-control rules. These decreases in atmospheric-Hg concentrations are believed to have resulted in the reduced atmospheric-Hg deposition recorded because precipitation depths between the two periods were not significantly different. The Hg-monitoring data for the study area identified an atmospheric deposition response to decreased local and regional Hg emissions.},

              Understanding of forest mercury (Hg) pools is important for quantifying the global atmospheric Hg removal. We studied gaseous elemental Hg (GEM) concentrations, litterfall Hg depositions, and pool sizes in four adjacent stands at Mount Dongling to assess Hg dynamics in the forested catchment and the potential of Hg release during wildfires. The average GEM concentration was 2.5 ± 0.5 ng m
              −3
              , about 1.5 times of the background levels in the Northern Hemisphere. In all four stands, Hg concentrations increase in the following order: bole wood {\textless} branch/twig {\textless} bark {\textless} mineral soil {\textless} needles/leaves {\textless} litterfall {\textless} Oi litter {\textless} Oe soil {\textless} Oa organic soil. The Hg pools of aboveground biomass were comparable in the forests of larch, oak, and Chinese pine, which were much greater than that of mixed broadleaf stands due to lower biomass. The total Hg pools in ecosystems were similar in the four stands, because of the comparable Hg pool in the soil horizons (0–40 cm), which accounted for over 97\% of the total ecosystem Hg storage in the four stands. Although Hg pools of the forest ecosystem in north China were comparable to North America and North Europe, Hg storage in forests constituted a high threat for large Hg emission pulses to the atmosphere by wildfires. The potential Hg emissions from the combustion at the four stands were ranged from 0.675 to 1.696 mg m

Mercury (Hg) concentrations and deposition fluxes in precipitation and litterfall were measured at multiple sites (six rural sites and an urban site) across a broad geographic area in China. The annual deposition fluxes of Hg in precipitation at rural sites and an urban site were 2.0 to 7.2 and 12.6 ± 6.5 µg m−2 yr−1, respectively. Wet deposition fluxes of Hg at rural sites showed a clear regional difference with elevated deposition fluxes in the subtropical zone, followed by the temporal zone and arid/semi-arid zone. Precipitation depth is the primary influencing factor causing the variation of wet deposition. Hg fluxes through litterfall ranged from 22.8 to 62.8 µg m−2 yr−1, higher than the wet deposition fluxes by a factor of 3.9 to 8.7 and representing approximately 75 \% of the total Hg deposition at the forest sites in China. This suggests that uptake of atmospheric Hg by foliage is the dominant pathway to remove atmospheric Hg in forest ecosystems in China. Wet deposition fluxes of Hg at rural sites of China were generally lower compared to those in North America and Europe, possibly due to a combination of lower precipitation depth, lower GOM concentrations in the troposphere and the generally lower cloud base heights at most sites that wash out a smaller amount of GOM and PBM during precipitation events.},

The forest field hosts an enormous amount of atmospheric Hg, and its reserves is estimated to be 25 341 µg m2. The ratio of output to input Hg fluxes (0.34) is higher compared with other study sites.

	abstract = {Abstract. In this study, mercury (Hg) was sampled weekly in dry and wet deposition and throughfall and monthly in litterfall, and as it was volatilized from soil from August 2008 to February 2010 to identify the factors influencing the amount of atmospheric Hg deposited to forested areas in a temperate deciduous forest in South Korea. For this location there was no significant correlation between the estimated monthly dry deposition flux (litterfall + throughfall – wet deposition) (6.7 µg m−2 yr−1) and directly measured dry deposition (9.9 µg m−2 yr−1) likely due primarily to Hg losses from the litterfall collector. Dry deposition fluxes in cold seasons (fall and winter) were lower than in warmer seasons (spring and summer). The volume-weighted mean (VWM) Hg concentrations in both precipitation and throughfall were highest in winter, likely due to increased scavenging by snow events. Since South Korea experiences abundant rainfall in summer, VWM Hg concentrations in summer were lower than in other seasons. Litterfall fluxes were highest in the late fall to early winter, when leaves were dropped from the trees (September to November). The cumulative annual Hg emission flux from soil was 6.8 µg m−2 yr−1. Based on these data, the yearly deposition fluxes of Hg calculated using two input approaches (wet deposition + dry deposition or throughfall + litterfall) were 6.8 and 3.6 µg m−2 yr−1, respectively. This is the first reported study which measured the amount of atmospheric Hg deposited to forested areas in South Korea, and thus our results provide useful information to compare against data related to Hg fate and transport in this part of the world.},

	abstract = {Litterfall, precipitation and nutrient fluxes were investigated in a 0.25 ha plot of a secondary lowland rain forest in Ile-Ife, Nigeria, for a period of one year. The study determined the magnitude of nutrient fluxes through (litterfall, incident rainfall, throughfall and stemflow) and evaluated the relative importance of these components as pathways of nutrient transport to the soil of this forest. There was a significant monthly variation in litterfall and the highest values of the standing crop of litter occurred from November to March. The concentration of elements in both throughfall and stemflow were higher than those of incidence rainfall. Greater quantities of calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper and nitrogen were deposited annually from the forest floor while greater quantities of mercury, potassium, sodium, phosphorus, lead and sulphur were deposited via precipitation. There was net leaching of all elements from the canopy as precipitation pass through it with the exception of copper, hydrogen ions and lead, which were retained in the canopy. The finding of this study shows that litterfall is the major pathway for the cycling of calcium, magnesium, nitrogen and all micronutrients investigated. Net precipitation is the major pathway for the cycling of potassium, phosphorus, sulphur and trace toxic metals (mercury and lead) in the forest.

            Produção de serapilheira, precipitação e o fluxo de nutrientes foram investigados em uma parcela de 0,25 ha de uma floresta pluvial secundária de terras baixas em Ile-Ife, Nigéria, por um período de um ano. O estudo determinou a magnitude dos fluxos de nutrientes através da serrapilheira, da chuva incidente, da interceptada, da escoada pelo tronco, e também avaliou a importância relativa desses componentes como vias de transporte de nutrientes para o solo desta floresta. Houve variação mensal significativa na produção e acúmulo de serapilheira com maiores valores ocorrendo de novembro a março. A concentração de elementos em tanto na chuva interceptada como na escoada pelo tronco foram maiores que na chuva incidente. Maiores quantidades de cálcio, magnésio, ferro, cobre, zinco e nitrogênio foram depositados anualmente a partir da serrapilheira no chão da floresta, enquanto maiores quantidades de mercúrio, potássio, sódio, fósforo, chumbo e enxofre foram depositados através de precipitação. Ocorreu lixiviação de todos os elementos pela passagem da precipitação pelo dossel com a exceção de cobre, íons de hidrogênio, e chumbo, que foram retidos no dossel. Como conclusão este estudo mostra que a serapilheira é a principal via para a ciclagem de cálcio, magnésio, nitrogênio e todos micronutrientes investigados. A precipitação é o principal via para a ciclagem de potássio, fósforo, enxofre e traços de metais tóxicos (mercúrio e chumbo) na floresta.},

	abstract = {Abstract. China is regarded as the largest contributor of mercury (Hg) to the global atmospheric Hg budget. However, concentration levels and depositions of atmospheric Hg in China are poorly known. Continuous measurements of atmospheric gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) were carried out from May 2008 to May 2009 at the summit of Mt. Leigong in south China. Simultaneously, deposition fluxes of THg and MeHg in precipitation, throughfall and litterfall were also studied. Atmospheric GEM concentrations averaged 2.80±1.51 ng m−3, which was highly elevated compared to global background values but much lower than semi-rural and industrial/urban areas in China. Sources identification indicates that both regional industrial emissions and long range transport of Hg from central, south and southwest China were corresponded to the elevated GEM level. Seasonal and diurnal variations of GEM were observed, which reflected variations in source intensity, deposition processes and meteorological factors. Precipitation and throughfall deposition fluxes of THg and MeHg in Mt. Leigong were comparable or lower compared to those reported in Europe and North America, whereas litterfall deposition fluxes of THg and MeHg were higher compared to Europe and North America. This highlights the importance of vegetation to Hg atmospheric cycling. In th remote forest ecosystem of China, deposition of GEM via uptake of foliage followed by litterfall was very important for the depletion of atmospheric Hg. Elevated GEM level in ambient air may accelerate the foliar uptake of Hg through air which may partly explain the elevated litterfall deposition fluxes of Hg observed in Mt. Leigong.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The legacy of long-term mining activities in Wanshan mercury (Hg) mining area (WMMA), Guizhou, China including a series of environmental issues related to Hg pollution. The spatial distribution of gaseous elemental mercury (Hg0) concentrations in ambient air were monitored using a mobile RA-915+ Zeeman Mercury Analyzer during daytime and night time in May 2010. The data imply that calcines and mine wastes piles located at Dashuixi and on-going artisanal Hg mining activities at Supeng were major sources of atmospheric mercury in WMMA. For a full year (May 2010 to May 2011), sampling of precipitation and throughfall were conducted on a weekly basis at three sites (Shenchong, Dashuixi, and Supeng) within WMMA. Hg in deposition was characterized by analysis of total Hg (THg) and dissolved Hg (DHg) concentrations. The corresponding data exhibit a high degree of variability, both temporarily and spatially. The volume-weighted mean THg concentrations in precipitation and throughfall samples were 502.6 ng l−1 and 977.8 ng l−1 at Shenchong, 814.1 ng l−1and 3392.1 ng l−1 at Dashuixi, 7490.1 ng l−1and 9641.5 ng l−1 at Supeng, respectively. THg was enhanced in throughfall compared to wet deposition samples by up to a factor of 7. The annual wet Hg deposition fluxes were 29.1, 68.8 and 593.1 μg m−2 yr−1 at Shenchong, Dashuixi and Supeng, respectively, while the annual dry Hg deposition fluxes were estimated to be 378.9, 2613.6 and 6178 μg m−2 yr−1 at these sites, respectively. Dry deposition played a dominant role in total atmospheric Hg deposition in WMMA since the dry deposition fluxes were 10.4–37.9 times higher than the wet deposition fluxes during the whole sample period. Our data showed that air deposition was still an important pathway of Hg contamination to the local environment in WMMA.},

              Forest ecosystems play an important role in the global cycling of mercury (Hg). In this study, we characterized the Hg cycling at a remote evergreen broadleaf (EB) forest site in southwest China (Mount Ailao). The annual Hg input via litterfall is estimated to be 75.0 ± 24.2 µg m
              −2
               yr
              −1
              at Mount Ailao. Such a quantity is up to 1 order of magnitude greater than those observed at remote temperate/boreal (T/B) forest sites. Production of litter biomass is found to be the most influential factor causing the high Hg input to the EB forest. Given their large areal coverage, Hg deposition through litterfall in EB forests is appropriately 9 ± 5 Mg yr
              −1
              in China and 1086 ± 775 Mg yr
              −1
              globally. The observed wet Hg deposition at Mount Ailao is 4.9 ± 4.5 µg m
              −2
               yr
              −1
              , falling in the lower range of those observed at 49 T/B forest sites in North America and Europe. Given the data, the Hg deposition flux through litterfall is approximately 15 times higher than the wet Hg deposition at Mount Ailao. Steady Hg accumulation in decomposing litter biomass and Hg uptake from the environment were observed during 25 months of litter decomposition. The size of the Hg pool in the organic horizon of EB forest floors is estimated to be up to 2–10 times the typical pool size in T/B forests. This study highlights the importance of EB forest ecosystems in global Hg cycling, which requires further assessment when more data become available in tropical forests.
